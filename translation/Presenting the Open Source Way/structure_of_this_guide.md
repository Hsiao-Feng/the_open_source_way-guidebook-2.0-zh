### Structure of This Guide

Each section of this guide consists of one or more chapters.

A chapter represents discussion of a discrete topic or closely-related set of topics.

The idea is that you can open and read a chapter as a stand-alone experience without needing to
read the rest of the guide to understand and act from the material in that chapter.

The vision for the 2.x series of this guidebook is for each chapter to consist of several aspects. The
version number in brackets indicates when that aspect is planned to appear:

- An introduction. [2.0]
- Primary material, written in third-person point-of-view, focusing on a balance of what, how,
    and why content. The examples (stories) told here are brief and in the third person. [2.0]
- Each chapter contains a lexicon at the end that defines the special usage for terms within that
    chapter. [2.1]
- Expanded stories come at the end of the chapter, and are one or more stories from the chapter
    author(s). These may be written in the first person—that may be the most effective way to make
    the point in many cases. These stories are modular, in that another story that makes a similar
    point but from a different situation can be used instead. [2.2]
       ◦ The idea is to start with a base story or set of stories in a chapter, and supplement or
          substitute other stories that are contributed to the project, such as through the interview
          effort. [2.1, 2.2]

Finally, we’re collecting stories from practitioners of the open source way, stories we know tend to
illustrate more than one principle in action. The idea is to start with a base story or set of stories in
a chapter, and supplement or substitute other stories that are contributed to the project, such as
through the interview effort. Stories not interspersed into chapters will be collected at the end of
the guide (for your endless uses).

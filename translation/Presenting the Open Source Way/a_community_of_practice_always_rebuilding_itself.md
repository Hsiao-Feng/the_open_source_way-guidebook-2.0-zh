### A Community of Practice Always Rebuilding Itself

What you are reading here is just one facet of the growing body of principles, implementations, and
examples that this community is gathering, cultivating, and maintaining.

In the end, it’s just one way to pull this material together (one method, you might say, of organizing
the madness). We’ll be updating this guide. We’ll be issuing similar, new guides. And we’ll
experiment with other ways to understand and present this material.

But at the core—in addition to the _what_ and the _how_ that benefit your open source
community—you will also learn to understand the _why_ , and be able to spread those stories
wherever you go.

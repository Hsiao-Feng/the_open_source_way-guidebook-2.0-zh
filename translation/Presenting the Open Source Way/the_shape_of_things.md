### The Shape of Things (I.e., Assumptions We Are Making)

When you look at this guide’s table of contents, notice the organizational flow: from user to
participant to contributor. This arrangement specifically tracks our view of how a community
comes about and grows. And it all starts with a need. If you’ve worked in open source projects and
communities, you’ve likely seen the cycle many times. It goes something like this:

1. A person or group addressing a problem creates the first iteration of software that offers one
    solution to that problem.
2. Other people with similar needs start using it, forming the core of a userbase.
3. From the userbase arise enthusiasts, people who promote the software and the community
    emerging around it (that is, the values and principles that project seems to espouse).
4. Eventually arising from the users and the enthusiasts come people who are interested in (and


```
have grown capable of ) contributing to the software in some way; they ensure the project
remains active and responds to the changing nature of the problem for which it was originally
developed.
```
Thus, the primary and continual focus for a project is to _take good care of your users_ , for some of
them will become your contributors, and you want them to do it out of love more than resentment.

A key element of all this is recognizing the value in contributions of all types, at all levels. Rather
than valorizing only a single type of contribution, the best practice is to treat all manner of gifts to
the project as equal. These contributions comprise content and code, hours and effort, and all types
of broad contributions for the project via events, discussion forums, infrastructure maintenance,
and so on.

When you lower barriers to participation, you make your project welcoming at all levels. This
doesn’t mean you _remove all barriers_ —just lower most of them appropriately. Appropriate barriers
are necessary for someone receiving keys to systems, for example, and these barriers are different
from those allowing only certain participants to contribute a help article or a patch to the
configuration management system.

**Our core opinion**

There is an opinion at the core of this work, that explains how the content is laid out, how the steps
on the path are revealed so that you can find yourself wherever you are in your journey of open
source practice.

Focus on your end users and lower the barriers to participation all around.

Contributors arise from participants, who all started as users.

```
Make your software wildly successful by having a user-centric initiative,
while making the community open and welcoming those users curious
enough to investigate how the software gets created.
```
The pathway of this guidebook therefore is:

1. **Attract users** to your software because it solves the problems they have; then
2. **Guide participants** who care about open source and sharing good solutions so they can be
    effective enthusiasts for your software; and
3. **Grow contributors** from this rich, fertile user and enthusiast base, by making sure when any of
    those folks look into how the software is made, they see themselves represented and can
    imagine how they could fit in, too. Make sure when they get to the contributor party, the
    barriers are clearly lowered and welcoming.

Think of it this way: It’s one thing to let people know about your great dance party. It’s another
thing to empower those dancers to advocate for your way of throwing a dance party. It’s a very
great thing to make the dance party able to evolve to welcome all manner of music and dance from
the world around us.


To get the dancers who see your poster and show up is the first step to stick around, and it helps if
they can see right away that this is a place for them and theirs, too.

You can see this pathway to project success doesn’t necessarily emphasize expertise (or even
existing skills relevant to the project) more than curiosity and willingness to try the software, to
care about the software, and to help create the software. This does not mean that people don’t bring
skills to the project; they do, many of them right from first point of contact with the project. But it is
easier to teach skills than to teach someone to truly care about your project.

In this journey, there are many best practices we recommend, including how to put together a plan
for measuring your community’s progress. We also list some specific areas to be careful of and
watch out for, including a robust discussion on self-care and mental health considerations for
community managers themselves.

Our best way of more-deeply conveying all this information is with stories. Aside from stories that
naturally arise in the body of the chapter, there are other areas in the guidebook and in The Open
Source Way community to gather all these stories of why.
